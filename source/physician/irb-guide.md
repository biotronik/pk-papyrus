The PK Papyrus Covered Coronary stent is FDA approved and BIOTRONIK will commercially launch PK Papyrus in 2019.

We recommend interested hospitals plan IRB submission for PK Papyrus in early 2019. The IRB Information Guide provides information to support facilities in obtaining IRB approval and provide details of the applicable FDA regulations associated with the use of the PK Papyrus Covered Coronary Stent System Humanitarian Use Device. The IRB Information Guide can be downloaded below.

Facilities should evaluate whether a local or central IRB may be used to obtain approval for the use of the PK Papyrus HUD at the facility. Further details are available in the FDA Guidance Document <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm110203.pdf" target="_blank">“Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Regulation: Questions and Answers. Guidance for HDE Holders, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration Staff”</a> Issued July 8, 2010.
