See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. And maybe a little bush lives there. There we go.

You can create anything that makes you happy. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.
